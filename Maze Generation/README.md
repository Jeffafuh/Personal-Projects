Inspired by the dungeon crawling game from 1980, "Rogue".

Once compiled, "rogueRunner.java" contains the main method to be exectued to run the program. Once run, the program will randomly generate rooms and paths connecting all of the rooms.
The player (red circle) can traverse through the maze with limited vistion using the arrow keys. Spaces inside rooms that can be traversed are marked by green dots and spaces outside rooms are marked by a checkered pattern.
