# Maze Generation

Inspired by the dungeon crawling game from 1980, "Rogue".

## Running The Project

This project was created in JCreator as a workspace using JDK 1.8.

Either import the workspace in JCreator or compile all of the .java files together located in /src/.
Once compiled, "rogueRunner.java" contains the main method to be executed to run the program.

## Description

Once run, the program will randomly generate rooms and paths connecting all of the rooms. The player (red circle) can traverse through the maze with limited vistion using the arrow keys. Spaces inside rooms that can be traversed are marked by green dots and spaces outside rooms are marked by a checkered pattern.
