A simple 2D raycasting demo inspired by The Coding Train.

Once compiled, "raycasting.java" contains the main function to be exectued to run the program.

On the left side of the screen contains the "top-down" view of the map, the player, and their line of sight. 
The right side of the screen contains the "first-person" view of the player. 
The player can move using the W/S keys and can rotate using A/D.

Currently, there is no collision and the player can traverse through the walls.
