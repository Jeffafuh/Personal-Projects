# Raycasting Demo
A simple 2D raycasting demo inspired by The Coding Train.

## Running The Project
This project was created in JCreator as a workspace using JDK 1.8.

Either import the workspace in JCreator or compile all of the .java files together located in /src/. Once compiled, "raycasting.java" contains the main method to be executed to run the program.

## Description

The left side of the screen contains the "top-down" view of the map, the player, and their line of sight. 

The right side of the screen contains the "first-person" view of the player. 

The player can move using the W/S keys and can rotate using A/D.

Currently, there is no collision and the player can traverse through the walls. (Feature)
