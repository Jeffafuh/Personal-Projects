# Fourier Series Demo
An interactive demo on Fourier Series inspired by 3b1b.

## Running The Project

This project was created in JCreator as a workspace using JDK 1.8.

Either import the workspace in JCreator or compile all of the .java files together located in /src/.
Once compiled, "fourierSeries.java" contains the main method to be executed to run the program.

## Description

On the left side of the screen contains buttons to create and manipulate vectors on the plane (animated on screen with the equation(s) on the top) as well as display various graphs.

Most notably, the "draw!" button allows the user to create a drawing, and once done, will calculate a Fourier Series to approximate the drawing.
The plane is scalable (mousewheel) and moveable (dragging w/ mouse).

## Known Bugs
BUG: In the "draw!" screen, pressing the "done" button without drawing anything will cause the program to crash. So please do as the button says and draw something :)
