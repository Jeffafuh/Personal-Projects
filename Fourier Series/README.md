An interactive demo on Fourier Series inspired by 3b1b.

Once compiled, "fourierSeries.java" contains the main method to be executed to run the program.
On the left side of the screen contains buttons to create and manipulate vectors on the plane (animated on screen with the equation(s) on the top) as well as display various graphs.
Most notably, the "draw!" button allows the user to create a drawing, and once done, will calculate a Fourier Series to approximate the drawing.
The plane is scalable (mousewheel) and moveable (dragging w/ mouse).

BUG: In the "draw!" screen, pressing the "done" button without drawing anything will cause the program to crash. So please do as the button says and draw something :)
