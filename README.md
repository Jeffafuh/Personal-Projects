# Personal-Projects

All of the personal projects that I've worked on in my spare time over the years!
From my junior-year of highschool to present-day (hopefully), all of these projects vary on how they were created and how they should be run.

Please see the README included in each directory for more details on how to run the project + a little background on what it is!

Thanks :)
