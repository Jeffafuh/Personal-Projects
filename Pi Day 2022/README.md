# Pi-Day 2022: Random Walks
A visual demo of using random walks to approximate Pi made in celebration of Pi-Day 3/14/2022.

## Running The Project
This project was created in Python 3.8 using Manim Community v0.15.1 (The Manim Community Developers. (2022). Manim â€“ Mathematical Animation Framework (Version v0.15.1) [Computer software]. https://www.manim.community/)

For more information on how to run a Manim project to create a video, please visit [their website](https://www.manim.community/).

## Description
There are two main folders, *src* and *Finished Videos*.

### *src*
Contains the main file used to generate the completed videos demonstrating the approximation method. *main.py* contains several different classes used to generate their respective videos.

### *Finished Videos*
If you do not wish to run the scripts yourself, completed videos can be found here available in 1080p. CalcPiPolar demonstrates the approximation method using random walks created by generating random angles, whereas CalcPiRectangular uses a lattice-based random walk.

Alternatively, you can view the completed videos in my [twitter post](https://twitter.com/jeffafuhh/status/1503494923076702210)
