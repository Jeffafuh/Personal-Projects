# Hitomezashi Stitching
My attempt of generalizing Hitomezashi stitching patterns to the entire family of regular n-gons.

## Running The Project
This project was created in Python 3.8 using Manim Community v0.14.0 (The Manim Community Developers. (2022). Manim â€“ Mathematical Animation Framework (Version v0.14.0) [Computer software]. https://www.manim.community/)

For more information on how to run a Manim project to create a video, please visit [their website](https://www.manim.community/).

## Description
There are two main folders, *src* and *Finished Videos*.

### *src*
Contains all of the files used to generate the completed videos demonstrating the stitching patterns. *ngon.py* contains all of the information/algorithms used to generate a single regular n-gon to be displayed on the screen whereas *construction/mainDemo.py* contains the actual scenes and animations used to create the final videos.

### *Finished Videos*
If you do not wish to run the scripts yourself, completed videos can be found here available in 4k and 1080p. Construction Demo demonstrates the steps of my construction I used to generalize Hitomezashi stitching from a square to any n-gon. Main Demo demonstrates the actual stitching patterns in action for n-gons n=3 to n=8 (excluding n=5).
