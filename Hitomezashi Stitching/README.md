# Hitomezashi Stitching
My attempt of generalizing Hitomezashi stitching patterns to the entire family of regular n-gons.

## Running The Project
This project was created in Python 3.8 using Manim Community v0.14.0 (The Manim Community Developers. (2022). Manim â€“ Mathematical Animation Framework (Version v0.14.0) [Computer software]. https://www.manim.community/)

For more information on how to run a Manim project to create a video, please visit [their website](https://www.manim.community/).
