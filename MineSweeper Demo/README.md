It's Minesweeper.

Once compiled, "MineSweeperRunner.java" contains the main method to be executed to run the program. Once run, generates a 16x16 Minesweeper board following all regular Minesweeper rules.
Left click "digs" and right click/M3 places a flag on the selected square. Revealing a black square indicates hitting a mine and the game is over, also revealing the location of all other mines as well.
On the right, clicking the smiley-face can be used to reset and generate a new board. The blue/red square can be toggled to change the behavior of left click.
The "blue mode" represents a regular left click, and the "red mode" indicates a flag mode where left click instead places a flag as opposed the revealing it.

Yup, it's minesweeper alright.
