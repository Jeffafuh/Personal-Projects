# Personal Grading Script
The grading script that I personally use to generate my comments on assignments for "CS 3333: Mathematical Foundations" and "CS 2233: Discrete Math" at UTSA.

## Description
Instructions on how the format of the data file is included in the .awk file. "run.bash" is included for (my) convenience, "formatGrades.awk" can be used on its own just fine using awk if needed.

Created using vim.
